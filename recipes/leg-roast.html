        <li>1 (5 pound) leg of lamb, trimmed of excess fat</li>
        <li>4 cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground red chile pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chaat masala</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut deep slashes about 2 inches apart across the lamb. </li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, ground red chile, 
            chaat masala, garam masala, salt, red pepper flakes, turmeric, 
            black pepper, cumin, and coriander together in a bowl. Whisk until well combined. 
            Apply marinade generously all over the lamb in a dish; turn over and apply more marinade. 
            Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large cast-iron pot over medium heat. 
            Place the lamb leg gently into the bottom of the pot. 
            Cover and place a heavy weight on top of the lid. 
            Reduce heat to low and cook for 1 hour. Turn leg over and cook for another hour. </li>
        <li>Continue cooking lamb until liquid is mostly evaporated and meat is tender and golden, 
            about 15 minutes more. Oils should start collecting at the edges of the lamb. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at 
            least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer meat to a serving dish. </li>
