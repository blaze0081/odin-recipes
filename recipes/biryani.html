    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, 
            and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder. </li>
        <li> Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. </li>
        <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, 
            biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. 
            Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked 
            through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain. </li>
        <li> Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. 
            Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. 
            Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 
            1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside. </li>
        <li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. 
            Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. 
            Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. 
            Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice. </li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, 
            about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is 
            tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes. </li>
